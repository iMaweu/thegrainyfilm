		  <p>Photography has been a passion of mine since college and throughout the years I have seen my focus shift from the latest and best gear to thinking about what ideas can be expressed through this medium. Therefore, one of the aims of this site is to document and share what I learn from others. If I can develop my photography and create images that convey my ideas then I would consider that a success.</p>
          <p>Secondly, this site is hosted through GitHub if you haven't noticed by the strange domain name. This is because I wanted to develop my coding skills by creating webpages using HTML, CSS and later possibly JavaScript. Therefore, the posts about photography provide the content for this site, which is being developed as I learn more about web programming and web design. So far using codecademy and tutorials found on the Microsoft website I have been able to build this site from scratch. However, there is some much more I would like to add or develop, for example, allowing visitors to share comments without having to email me, creating a gallery and developing a structure to organise my blog posts. What's quite interesting is that GitHub records the changes I make to this website so anyone can see how this site has developed.</p> 
          <p>Finally, I would like to say feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:thegrainyfilm@gmail.com" target="_top">thegrainyfilm@gmail.com</a> about any images you like or want to use, corrections or if you want to comment about any of my posts.</p>
